# Intro

Podmark is an iOS app that "bookmarks" podcasts. You bookmark a podcast by sharing it from another app (or, manually, by copying a link). Later, you can reopen the link in the original app or website. Alternatively you can export your bookmarks as text, RSS, or JSON.

# SwiftUI

I originally wrote this app completely in SwiftUI. I've decided to switch at least part of it to UIKit. There are some weird UI bugs in SwiftUI and it was difficult to acheive things like swipe-to-delete. The [swiftui branch](https://github.com/davidalbers/podmark-ios/tree/swiftui) is still around for reference.
